One:
what combination of parameters is producing the hit rate you observe? (Hint: Your answer should be of the form: "Because [parameter A] in bytes is exactly equal to [parameter B] in bytes.")

step size = block size

What is our hit rate if we increase Rep Count arbitrarily? Why?

wouldn't change since the whole cache is being skipped

How could we modify one program parameter to increase our hit rate? (Hint: Your answer should be of the form: "Change [parameter] to [value]." Note: we don't care if we access the same array elements. Just give us a program parameter modification that would increase the hit rate.

decrease step size


Two:
How many memory accesses are there per iteration of the inner loop? (not the one involving repcount). It's not 1.

2

What is the repeating hit/miss pattern? WHY? (Hint: it repeats every 4 accesses).

It misses first then hits 3 times since.


This should follow very straightforwardly from the above question: Explain the hit rate in terms of the hit/miss pattern.


Keeping everything else the same, what happens to our hit rate as Rep Count goes to infinity? Why?
